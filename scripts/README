ams_netlist.pl is a script that calls the Virtuoso 'runams' command in a temporary folder and then does some post processing to make the files more SV/Verilog-AMS LRM compliant. It is well 
documented on what the script does at each stage, but may not cover every possible output from the 'runams' command as the number of testcase used to test it was limited. 

snps_attribte_to_cmd is a script that reads a warning file generated by VCS about non-LRM attribute statements and convert this to a set of ams_* commands that are read in by XA.
