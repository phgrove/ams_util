These are modified connect module from the default ones supplied with the Synopsys AMS simulator.

- Logic drive strength to output resistance mapping. (Require VPI code to do this.)
- Toggle counter to help identify incorrect partitioning.
- Optional current limited electrical output for L2E/BiDir.
- Code in place to support the Verilog-AMS 2023 $receiver_count() to optimize the L2E/Bidir when there are not logic receivers on the net.
